### 🧼 Best Practices

- Always pull the latest changes from `main` before starting:
  ```
  git pull origin main
  ```

- Create a new branch from your assigned GitHub issue.

- Use meaningful commit messages, ex: `build: add Hero component markup`.

- Use SCSS variables, font mixins, and responsive design via mixins.

- Don't push directly to `main` — always create a pull request!
